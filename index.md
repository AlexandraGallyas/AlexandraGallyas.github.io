## RESEARCH

I am a third-year Ph.D. student at Cornell University. I work with Professor [Christoph Studer](http://vip.ece.cornell.edu), who is now an Associate Professor at [ETH Zurich](https://iis.ee.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.cstuder.html). My research is on baseband algorithms for wireless multi-antenna communication systems. More broadly, I am interested in applying statistical techniques to model signals corrupted by noise or distortions, and then using such models to design efficient algorithms that recover the signal of interest.
